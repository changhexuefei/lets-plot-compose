# Lets-Plot Compose Frontend Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Compatibility

Current development baseline:
- Kotlin 2.4.20
- Compose Multiplatform 1.12.1
- Lets-Plot Kotlin API 4.15.1-SNAPSHOT
- Lets-Plot Multiplatform 4.11.1-SNAPSHOT

### Added

- Shared default plot toolbar on Desktop, Android, and WasmJS.
- WasmJS hyperlink navigation using the browser window.
- Android hyperlink navigation through the Compose URI handler, with lifecycle-safe callback cleanup.
- Dedicated multiplatform UI-parity and interaction-contract CI evidence.
- Published-Maven standalone consumer smoke for Android and WasmJS, including Android release AAR and Wasm production bundle verification.
- 3.2.3 release-candidate readiness gate covering Desktop/Android/Wasm consumer evidence and publication inventory.
- Release dependency preflight that blocks a final 3.2.3 version from depending on SNAPSHOT Lets-Plot artifacts, verifies non-SNAPSHOT upstream artifacts against Maven Central, and records the current pre-release state.
- Signed 3.2.3 release-bundle rehearsal using an ephemeral CI key and the known released 4.11.0/4.15.0 upstream pair, without external publication.
- Full release-bundle integrity coverage requiring every Maven payload and its detached GPG signature to have verified SHA-256/SHA-512 checksum evidence, plus a retained hash inventory.
- Lightweight 3.2.3 upstream-release readiness workflow that checks the target Lets-Plot 4.11.1 and Kotlin API 4.15.1 artifacts on Maven Central without running the full compatibility matrix.
- Deterministic upstream-readiness contract test covering both the available and waiting state transitions with a temporary local Maven repository.
- Compatibility CI scope gate that skips the heavy matrix for readiness-only metadata changes while preserving full CI for source, dependency-version, and compatibility-workflow changes.
- Live readiness-only workflow acceptance proving the scope gate skips both heavy roots and the downstream compatibility/release graph on GitHub Actions.
- Lightweight Graphite upstream-baseline watcher that keeps the experimental renderer baseline frozen until stable Compose >= 1.13.0 and Skiko >= 0.153.0 are both available, then requests a fresh compatibility probe without changing production rendering.
- Cross-platform toolbarless interaction feedback ownership so external FigureModel pan/zoom state updates consistently on Desktop, Android, and WasmJS.
- Source-compatible PlotPanel/PlotPanelRaw defaults for modifier, aspect-ratio, and computation-message callback ergonomics, verified by standalone published consumers.

### Changed

- Pointer interaction semantics are now locked to one common cross-platform contract for drag, move, wheel-axis selection, and Ctrl/Alt/Shift/Meta propagation.
- FigureModel dispatcher ownership and toolbar lifecycle are now keyed to the active figure model to prevent stale cleanup from detaching newer bindings.
- Computation messages are dispatched once per active raw plot spec and are re-enabled when the plot spec changes.
- CI publication bundles now include the Compose Android and WasmJS target artifacts required by root multiplatform module metadata.
- The Lets-Plot Compose project version now has a single source of truth in `gradle.properties` via `letsPlotCompose.version`.

### Fixed

- Android pressed-pointer movement now reports drag semantics consistently with Desktop and WasmJS.
- Android no longer discards keyboard modifiers or always prefers the vertical wheel delta.
- Reusing one PlotPanel for a different raw spec no longer suppresses computation messages after the first figure.
- Toolbar SVG icons now use common Compose ImageVector rendering instead of a Desktop/Skiko-only SVG decoder.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project adheres
to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). All scales should have the 'format' parameter.
